# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2022-07-01

Welcome to ET Webblog about Astro, gods and ET! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **A**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **B**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **C**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

    </ul>
